# SIWES Finder — Mobile App (Expo / React Native)

## The idea

A native Android (later iOS) app for the whole SIWES Finder platform,
serving the same four roles as the website: students find and apply to
placements, employers post and review, schools track their students, admins
stay on the web. Nigerian students are overwhelmingly mobile-first; a real
app adds what the responsive site can't:

- **Push notifications** — "your application was accepted", "your logbook
  entry was approved", "3 new Design placements match your skills".
- **Offline-friendly logbook** — draft daily entries without data, sync
  when back online. Logbook writing is a daily habit; the app should make
  it a 20-second task from the home screen.
- **Presence** — an icon on the student's phone beats a bookmarked URL for
  daily engagement, and a Play Store listing is a trust signal for schools
  and companies.

## Architecture — one backend, two clients

```
┌─────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────────┐        ┌─────────┐
│  Next.js    │  HTTPS │  Existing Next.js API routes │        │ MongoDB │
│  website    │───────▶│  /api/* on Vercel            │───────▶│  Atlas  │
└─────────────┘ cookie └──────────────────────────────┘        └─────────┘
                                    ▲
┌─────────────┐        Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
│  Expo app   │────────────────────┘
│  (mobile/)  │
└─────────────┘
```

- The app is a **client of the existing API** — no second backend, no data
  duplication. Every feature the app needs (jobs, applications, saved jobs,
  logbook, profile, uploads, school views) already has a JSON route; see
  `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` for the full API surface.
- Code lives in **`mobile/`** in this repo (Expo + TypeScript +
  expo-router). Monorepo means API changes and app changes ship in one PR
  and every session already has access.
- **TypeScript everywhere** — the same language and conventions as the
  site.

## Auth strategy (the one real backend change)

NextAuth sessions are cookie-based, which doesn't suit a native client. The
mobile app authenticates with **bearer tokens signed by the same
`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`**:

1. `src/lib/mobileAuth.ts` — sign/verify JWTs (`jose` or NextAuth's
   encode/decode helpers) carrying the same claims the web session token
   has: `id`, `role`.
2. `POST /api/mobile/login` — takes email + password (same bcrypt check as
   the web credentials provider in `src/lib/auth.ts`), returns
   `{ token, user }`. Token lifetime mirrors the web's rolling 2-hour
   session; the app silently re-issues on activity.
3. `requireSession(req)` wrapper — resolves the caller from **either** the
   NextAuth cookie **or** an `Authorization: Bearer` header, so each
   existing API route serves both clients with a one-line change. Adopt it
   route-by-route as the app needs them (Phase 1 list below), not
   big-bang.
4. Google sign-in on mobile via `expo-auth-session` is **Phase 2+** —
   credentials login ships first.
5. The app stores the token in `expo-secure-store` (encrypted device
   storage), never AsyncStorage.

## Phases

Keep this checklist current — tick items in the same PR that lands them.

### Phase 0 — Foundations
- [x] Scaffold Expo app in `mobile/` (TypeScript template + expo-router,
      via `create-expo-app`; demo/branding files from the template removed)
- [x] Typed API client (`mobile/src/api/client.ts` + `authStorage.ts` +
      `AuthContext.tsx`) with base-URL from env (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`; dev
      default `http://10.0.2.2:3000`, the Android emulator's localhost
      alias — override in `.env` for iOS Simulator/a physical device, see
      `mobile/.env.example`)
- [x] Backend: `src/lib/mobileAuth.ts` (`issueMobileToken` +
      `requireSession`) + `POST /api/mobile/login`, with route/unit tests
      following `__tests__/api/` and `__tests__/lib/` patterns.
      `requireSession` reuses `next-auth/jwt`'s own cookie-or-bearer lookup
      rather than a bespoke token format — no new auth system.
- [x] `/api/profile` GET retrofitted to `requireSession` as the
      proof-of-concept that a route can serve both clients; the rest of the
      API surface migrates route-by-route as Phase 1 screens need them.
- [x] CI: `mobile` job (install, `tsc --noEmit`, eslint) added to
      `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, path-filtered to `mobile/**` via
      `dorny/paths-filter`
- [x] Theming: brand tokens (primary `#2557eb` / dark `#5c86ff`, surface
      colors from `globals.css`) ported into the template's own
      `mobile/src/constants/theme.ts` rather than a second parallel theme
      file — one source of truth for colors, matching the convention
      `ThemedText`/`ThemedView` already expect
- [x] Minimal login → "hello, {name}" flow (`mobile/src/app/login.tsx`,
      `index.tsx`) proves the whole chain end-to-end: credentials login →
      bearer token in `expo-secure-store` → authenticated `/api/profile`
      fetch. Full navigation (Jobs/Applications/Logbook/Profile tabs)
      arrives in Phase 1.

**Done when:** a fresh checkout can `cd mobile && npm install && npx expo
start`, log in with a seeded account against the live API, and see a
"hello, {name}" screen. CI runs on mobile changes. **Not yet verified on an
actual device/emulator** — this was built and typechecked/linted in a
sandboxed environment with no Android/iOS runtime available; first real
device run is on the user.

### Phase 1 — Student MVP
- [x] Login / signup (credentials; role tabs like the web) —
      `mobile/src/app/signup.tsx` mirrors the web's student/company/school
      tabs and auto-logs in after `POST /api/auth/register`, same as the
      site. Non-student roles land on a "coming soon" holding screen (see
      below) rather than a broken Jobs feed, since Phase 1 only builds
      student screens.
- [x] Browse + search jobs (reuses `/api/jobs` incl. skill/company search) —
      `mobile/src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, with type filter chips and a
      debounced search box.
- [x] Job details + apply (platform/email/external methods) —
      `mobile/src/app/jobs/[id].tsx`, branching on `applicationMethod`
      exactly like the web's `ApplyButton`: email opens a `mailto:` link,
      external opens the company's URL, platform calls `POST
      /api/applications`.
- [x] Saved jobs (bookmark toggle, saved list) — a ★ toggle on job cards and
      the detail screen, plus a "Saved" filter chip on the Jobs screen
      (mirrors the web's `savedOnly` toggle rather than a separate nav item).
- [x] Applications tracker with status — `mobile/src/app/(tabs)/applications.tsx`.
- [x] Profile: academic details, faculty, skills, avatar + resume upload
      (`/api/upload` accepts multipart already) — `mobile/src/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`,
      using `expo-image-picker` (avatar) and `expo-document-picker` (resume
      PDF), each uploading immediately and persisting the URL via `PUT
      /api/profile`, same two-step flow as the web's `AvatarUpload`.
- [x] Backend: retrofitted every remaining student-facing route to
      `requireSession` (bearer-or-cookie) — `GET /api/jobs`, `GET
      /api/jobs/[id]`, `POST`+`GET /api/applications`, `GET`+`POST
      /api/saved-jobs`, `PUT /api/profile`, `POST /api/upload`. Each got a
      route test asserting `requireSession` (not the cookie-only
      `getServerSession`) is called with the raw request, on top of the
      existing route-logic test coverage.
- [x] Navigation: `(tabs)` group (Jobs / Applications / Profile) behind an
      auth + role gate in `mobile/src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`; `login`,
      `signup`, and `jobs/[id]` are full-screen stack routes outside the tab
      bar.

**Done when:** a student can go from install → signed in → applied → sees
the application in their tracker, entirely in the app.

**Two real bugs this surfaced and fixed, unrelated to mobile screens
directly but found while wiring them up:**
- `PUT /api/profile` was returning the full Mongoose user document,
  including the hashed password field, to the client. Both GET and PUT now
  `.select()` the same explicit safe-field list.
- `GET /api/profile`'s field-select never actually included `role`, so the
  Phase 0 `AuthContext` — which reads `profile.role` to restore the session
  on app boot — was silently always getting `undefined`. Fixed by adding
  `role` to the safe-field list (it isn't sensitive, unlike password).

**Not yet verified on an actual device/emulator** — same caveat as Phase 0:
built and typechecked/linted in a sandboxed environment with no
Android/iOS runtime available.

### Phase 2 — Logbook + push notifications
- [x] e-Logbook: write daily entries, week history —
      `mobile/src/app/(tabs)/logbook.tsx`, entries grouped by `weekNumber`
      (the schema's own natural grouping key — the web renders entries
      flat, so this is a fresh convention, not a ported one).
- [x] Offline drafts (queue locally, sync on reconnect) —
      `mobile/src/api/logbookDrafts.ts` queues a failed submit in
      AsyncStorage (only on a genuine network failure, not a server
      rejection like "no accepted placement yet"), and flushes on screen
      focus and on a `@react-native-community/netinfo` reconnect event.
- [x] `expoPushToken` field on User + register-device endpoint —
      `POST /api/mobile/register-push-token`; the client
      (`mobile/src/api/pushNotifications.ts`) registers on login and on
      session restore, no-oping quietly on a simulator/emulator, a denied
      permission, or **no EAS project linked yet** (see the setup table
      below — `getExpoPushTokenAsync` needs a real `projectId` to mint a
      token, which this sandboxed session can't produce without the
      owner's Expo account).
- [x] Server sends pushes on application decision — `PUT
      /api/applications/[id]` sends a best-effort push (`src/lib/push.ts`,
      wrapping `expo-server-sdk`) when an employer accepts/rejects; a
      delivery failure is logged and swallowed, never fails the status
      update itself.
- [x] ~~Server sends push on logbook approval~~ — **resolved in Phase 3.**
      This was originally dropped because the employer logbook-approval
      route had been deliberately removed in an earlier commit; flagged to
      the repo owner rather than silently reversed. Confirmed in Phase 3
      that it should come back (Phase 3's own scope needs employer approval
      anyway) — `PUT /api/logbook/[id]` is recreated there and the push
      send landed alongside it.

**Not yet verified on an actual device/emulator, and push notifications
specifically cannot be end-to-end tested until the app has a linked EAS
project** (see "One-time account setup" below) — the registration code
path is written and no-ops safely without one, but no real device token
can be minted in this sandboxed environment.

### Phase 3 — Employer & School
- [x] Employer: applicant list, accept/reject —
      `(tabs)/employer-applicants.tsx`, consuming `GET /api/applications`'s
      employer branch and `PUT /api/applications/[id]`, both already
      bearer-ready from Phase 1/2.
- [x] Employer: logbook approvals — `(tabs)/employer-logbook.tsx`. Required
      restoring `PUT /api/logbook/[id]` (deleted in an earlier commit) and
      the employer branch of `GET /api/logbook`, plus retrofitting
      `src/lib/schoolAuth.ts`'s `requireApprovedSchool()` — the one
      remaining auth helper untouched since Phase 0 — to accept bearer
      tokens. **This reverses a prior "logbooks are private" decision;
      done only after explicit user confirmation** (flagged in the Phase 2
      PR, confirmed before implementing here) — see `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`'s
      Employers section for the corrected, current behavior.
- [x] School: overview stats, student directory, logbook feed (read-only) —
      `(tabs)/school-overview.tsx`, `school-students.tsx` (grouped by
      faculty → department, tapping a student pushes
      `school/students/[id].tsx`), `school-logbooks.tsx` (status/department
      filters). No new stats endpoint — same as the web, KPIs are computed
      client-side from `GET /api/school/students`. All three
      `/api/school/**` routes now accept bearer tokens via the
      `requireApprovedSchool()` retrofit above.
- [x] Shared minimal `(tabs)/account.tsx` (name/email/role + sign out) for
      employer and school — full profile editing (company verification,
      institution accreditation, etc.) stays web-only; not in this phase's
      scope.

**Not yet verified on an actual device/emulator** — same caveat as every
prior phase.

### Phase 4 — Release (Android)
- [x] App icon + splash from the existing logomark (`src/app/icon.svg`'s
      two-circle mark) — regenerated every Android icon asset
      (`mobile/assets/images/icon.png`, `android-icon-{foreground,
      background,monochrome}.png`, `splash-icon.png`) from the brand SVG
      via `sharp`, white mark on the brand blue (`#2557eb`), respecting
      Android's adaptive-icon safe zone. `favicon.png` uses the original
      blue-on-transparent mark, matching the website's own favicon.
      **iOS's `assets/expo.icon/` (Apple's newer layered "Icon Composer"
      bundle format) was deliberately left untouched** — this phase is
      titled Release (Android), iOS icon work needs Apple's own tooling to
      verify visually and isn't scoped here.
- [x] Privacy policy page on the website (Play Store requirement) —
      `src/app/privacy/page.tsx`, linked from the homepage footer. Plain
      language, describes what's actually collected per role (including
      the mobile app's push token) and the third-party processors used
      (MongoDB Atlas, Vercel/Vercel Blob, Resend, Google, Expo) — not a
      lawyer-reviewed document, written in good faith for an MVP-stage
      platform; revisit if the platform scales significantly.
- [x] EAS build profile — `mobile/eas.json`, `production` (and `preview`)
      profiles both set `android.buildType: "apk"` (EAS's default for
      `production` is an AAB, Play-Store-only). An APK is what both chosen
      distribution paths below need. **Decision (owner, 2026-07-11): skip
      Google Play — no $25 registration fee.** Do both of the following
      instead, from the same build:
      1. **Direct download** — host the built `.apk` on the website; the
         owner adds the download link themselves once a build exists.
      2. **Free alternate app store** — Amazon Appstore and/or Huawei
         AppGallery, both free to register, both accept a plain APK. Either
         store's app can be installed on **any** Android device (not
         limited to Amazon/Huawei hardware) — same APK serves both this
         and the direct download above.
      `app.json`: `extra.eas.projectId` set (owner's Expo project),
      `android.package` set to `com.siwesfinder.app` (permanent once
      published anywhere, chosen deliberately). `expo-build-properties`
      plugin added with `enableMinifyInReleaseBuilds` +
      `enableShrinkResourcesInReleaseBuilds` (R8/Proguard + unused-resource
      stripping) and `buildArchs: ["armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a"]` (drops the
      `x86`/`x86_64` slices a universal APK bundles by default — those only
      ever run on emulators, never real phones — while keeping both real
      ARM architectures so older/budget Android devices still work) to
      bring the release APK size down from an initial ~100MB.
      **The owner runs the actual build** (this sandboxed environment
      can't reach `api.expo.dev` at all, confirmed by a direct connection
      test, so it can never run `eas` commands itself, credentials or not):
      ```
      cd mobile && eas build --platform android --profile production
      ```
      which uploads the resulting APK to expo.dev, downloadable from
      there or via the CLI's own link.
- [x] Direct download — the homepage's "Also on Android" banner
      (`src/app/page.tsx`) is live, currently pointing at the first
      production build's own EAS artifact link (hardcoded as the fallback
      default when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANDROID_APK_URL` is unset). **This is a
      stopgap, not the permanent link** — Expo's free tier only retains
      build artifacts for a limited time (~30 days). **TODO before it
      expires:** download the `.apk` from that link, attach it to a GitHub
      Release on this repo, and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANDROID_APK_URL` to the
      Release asset URL (in Vercel's env vars, or just update the
      fallback in `page.tsx` again) — then the temporary artifact-link
      fallback can be deleted.
- [ ] Amazon Appstore / Huawei AppGallery submission — not started; needs
      the owner's free developer account on each (see setup table below).
- [ ] Play Console submission — **explicitly out of scope**, per the
      decision above.
- [ ] Store listing (screenshots, description, feature graphic) — needed
      for the Amazon/Huawei submissions above; not started. Screenshots
      need a real build running on a device/emulator, which (like every
      prior phase) this sandboxed environment can't produce.

## One-time account setup (owner to-dos)

| What | Where | Cost | Needed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Expo account + `eas init` to link a project (writes `extra.eas.projectId` into `app.json`) | expo.dev | Free tier is enough to start | **Phase 2 and 4** — push notifications won't register without it, and it's required to run any EAS build at all |
| Signing keystore | Managed automatically by EAS | — | Phase 4 |
| Amazon Appstore developer account | developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games | Free | Phase 4 (chosen distribution path) |
| Huawei AppGallery developer account | developer.huawei.com | Free | Phase 4 (chosen distribution path) |
| ~~Google Play Console~~ | ~~play.google.com/console~~ | ~~$25 one-time~~ | **Not needed** — skipped per the owner's decision above |
| (Later, iOS) Apple Developer | developer.apple.com | $99/year | Phase 4+ |

## Conventions for sessions working on mobile

- Read `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` first (product/API truth), then this file
  (mobile plan + status). `PROGRESS.md` shows what landed recently.
- Every mobile PR: tick the phase checklist above, keep
  `PROJECT_SCOPE.md`'s mobile section accurate, and meet the same bar as
  the web app — typecheck, lint, and tests must pass in CI.
- Backend changes for mobile live in `src/` and get route tests like every
  other API change. Never fork backend logic into the app.
